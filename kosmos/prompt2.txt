Your goal is to design a protein (or peptide or antibody) capable of neutralizing the Nipah virus. Specifically, design a binder against the Nipah virus Glycoprotein G (NiV-G), the viral surface protein responsible for attaching the virus to human cells. NiV-G binds to the Ephrin-B2 and Ephrin-B3 receptors, which are present in the respiratory tract and central nervous system, enabling the virus to enter and infect host cells. By blocking or disrupting this interaction, binders targeting Glycoprotein G could prevent the virus from entering cells, making it a promising neutralization target.

The full sequence of Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G is:

However, experimental characterization will focus on the extracellular domain (residues 71-602) of the Glycoprotein G, which are:

A PBD structure of Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G (PDB ID 2VSM) was provided as an example to competition participants. You may use this example but should find others as well.

Your designs will participate in a protein design competition. Selected designs undergo experimental validation in the Adaptyv Lab. Proteins with the highest binding affinity against Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G win the competition. There will be two rankings: De Novo and Lead Optimization. Experimental validation will measure both the expression of protein designs and binding affinity to Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G. Binding affinity will be measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance, as described in the attached documentation from Adaptyv.

Additional competition rules are that each sequence must be 250 AA or shorter and proteins should be at least 10 amino acids from any published sequence.

Return 100 ranked candidate designs to submit to the competition. Provide each design as an amino acid sequence in an output .csv file along with any metrics used to score the design and a brief summary of the techniques used to create the design. You will follow the lead optimization strategy, where a lead is a known binder. Exhaustively search for known Nipah virus Glycoprotein G binders in the literature, clinical trials, the Protein Data Bank, and other sources to study their binding interfaces, sequences, and other properties. Use these starting sequences and interactions to design candidate binders with improved binding affinity and sufficient protein expression. Ensure all competition rules are followed. Provide a report showing that the competition rules regarding the maximum sequence length and distance from known binding sequences have been followed. Use other computational tools to estimate protein expression, stability, binding affinity, or other in silico metrics to guide the sequence design. Whenever possible, use existing validated tools instead of reimplementing algorithms with your own code.
