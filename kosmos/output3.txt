Tip
The objective is promising but needs more context and data. Provide: (1) PDB structures of NiV-G bound to receptors and any known antibody/binder complexes; (2) epitope/neutralization data or mapping (variants, glycosylation sites); (3) explicit expression system and assay constraints (tags, solubility, cysteine limits); (4) a curated list/database of known binders/antibody sequences to verify the "10 aa from published" rule; and (5) full SPR protocol and success metrics. Clarify allowed external tools/databases and any IP or biosafety restrictions. With these additions the task becomes well-posed.
