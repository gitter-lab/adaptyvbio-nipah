Your goal is to design a protein (or peptide or antibody) capable of neutralizing the Nipah virus. Specifically, design a binder against the Nipah virus Glycoprotein G (NiV-G) - the viral surface protein responsible for attaching the virus to human cells. NiV-G binds to the Ephrin-B2 and Ephrin-B3 receptors, which are present in the respiratory tract and central nervous system, enabling the virus to enter and infect host cells. By blocking or disrupting this interaction, binders targeting Glycoprotein G could prevent the virus from entering cells, making it a promising neutralization target.

The full sequence of Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G is:

However, experimental characterization will focus on the extracellular domain (residues 71-602) of the Glycoprotein G, which are:

Your designs will participate in a protein design competition. Selected designs undergo experimental validation in the Adaptyv Lab. Proteins with the highest binding affinity against Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G win the competition. There will be two rankings: De Novo and Lead Optimization. Experimental validation will measure both the expression of protein designs and binding affinity to Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G. Binding affinity will be measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance, as described in the attached documentation from Adaptyv.

Additional competition rules are that each sequence must be 250 AA or shorter and proteins should be at least 10 amino acids from any published sequence.

Return 100 ranked candidate designs to submit to the competition. You may pursue any strategy: De Novo binder generation, Lead Optimization from known binders (e.g. Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G antibodies), or both strategies. Ensure all competition rules are followed. You may use any computational tools to estimate protein expression, stability, binding affinity, or other in silico metrics to guide the sequence generation. You may search literature, clinical trials databases, PDB, and other resources to find candidates for lead optimization.
