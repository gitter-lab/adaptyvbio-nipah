Code and results for the 2025 [Adaptyv Bio Adaptyv Nipah Binder Competition](https://proteinbase.com/competitions/adaptyv-nipah-competition)

## Submissions
Our three person team made the following final submissions:
- Tapan Ravi: BindCraft
- Bryce Johnson: BindCraft plus a supervised model trained on ESM embeddings
- Anthony Gitter: Kosmos AI scientist ([Proteinbase](https://proteinbase.com/collections/nipah-binder-competition-submission-1-qYFdXgOpyS), [details](kosmos#adaptyv-submission-1))

## Notes
### Potential leads
- PDB [2VSM](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2VSM): provided by Adaptyv, Nipah virus attachment glycoprotein in complex with human cell surface receptor ephrinB2
- [University of Oxford’s ChAdOx1 NipahB vaccine candidate](https://cepi.net/establishing-worlds-largest-nipah-virus-vaccine-reserve): need to find sequence and details, check relevance to target
- [MBP1F5](https://cepi.net/new-human-trials-novel-antibody-offer-hope-immediate-protection-against-deadly-nipah): need to find sequence and details, check relevance to target
- [rVSV-Nipah vaccine candidate](https://cepi.net/cepi-awards-us436-million-public-health-vaccines-llc-development-single-dose-nipah-virus-vaccine): need to find sequence and details, is it the same as clinical trial [NCT05178901](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05178901) because that is likely irrelevant
- [Nipah virus vaccine candidate (HeV-sG-V)](https://cepi.net/cepi-funded-nipah-virus-vaccine-candidate-first-reach-phase-1-clinical-trial): need to find sequence and details, aka HenipaVaxTM, check clinical trial [NCT04199169](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04199169)
- [nAH1.3](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm5561): possibly other relevant information, check full paper
- Adaptyv added a list to the competition FAQ: m102.4 (anti-G glycoprotein), 1F5 / hu1F5 / MBP1F5 (anti-F glycoprotein), and mAb92.
